# Mastering Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning

## Introduction
This report documents my journey in mastering Python, data science, and machine learning through practical projects. A hands-on approach allowed me to develop essential skills and apply them to real-world datasets. This project was completed as part of an online hybrid self-paced course designed to develop in-demand data skills.

## Project Overview
### Project Title: Mall Customer Segmentation

**Description:**
This project involves analyzing a dataset using Python's powerful data science libraries. The goal is to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build a predictive machine learning model, and visualize the results. The project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow from raw data to actionable insights.

**Objectives:**

- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights through data visualization and summary statistics.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features to improve model performance.
- **Model Development:** Build and evaluate machine learning models.
- **Visualization:** Present findings through clear and informative visualizations.

**Technologies Used:**

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Project Workflow

### Data Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values:** Imputed missing values using methods such as mean, median, or mode imputation.
- **Removing Duplicates:** Identified and removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal:** Detected outliers using statistical methods and removed them to prevent skewing the analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Visualization:** Created various plots (histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to understand the distribution and relationships in the data.
- **Summary Statistics:** Calculated key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to summarize the data.

### Feature Engineering
- **Creating New Features:** Developed new features based on domain knowledge and data patterns to enhance model performance.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Encoded categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding.

### Model Development
- **Model Selection:** Explored various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests).
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Used cross-validation to ensure robust performance.

### Visualization
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Created dashboards using Plotly and Dash to present the findings interactively.
- **Final Report:** Generated a comprehensive report to summarize the project, including key insights and recommendations.

## Results
